=======================

This is a social networking site patterned after Facebook, built with vanilla PHP, Javascript and MySQL. No frameworks.

Before installing this in your development server, you need to have PHP and MySQL installed. If you are using Windows then the easiest way is by using XAMPP or WAMP. If you are using Linux, you need to make sure you have the necessary packages for PHP and MySQL. There are tons of tutorials online on how to prepare your development environment for use with PHP and MySQL, Google is your friend.

Thanks for looking.
